Employee Management System
In this challenge, you will implement an Employee Management System using JavaScript classes to handle employees and departments within a company. Youâ€™ll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and methods to create a scalable system. This system will allow you to manage employee details, handle departments, and calculate salaries and bonuses.

Scenario: A company wants to create a system to manage its employees and departments. The system should: 1. Store employee information, such as name, position, salary, and department. 2. Store department information, including department name and employees within the department. 3. Calculate the total salary for a department. 4. Handle bonuses for specific employees based on their performance. 5. Allow for different types of employees, such as regular employees and managers, each with unique properties.
